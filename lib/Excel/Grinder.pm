=head1 NAME

Excel::Grinder - Import/export plain Excel (XLSX) files as simply as possible.

=head1 DESCRIPTION / PURPOSE

This module should help you read/write XLSX spreadsheets to/from Perl arrays 
as simply as possible. The use cases are (1) when you need to export data from 
your database/application for non-programmers to enjoy in their beloved Excel 
and (2) when you need to allow for batch import/update operations via 
user-provided Excel.

There are so many awesome things you can do with Excel (formatting, formulas, 
pivot tables, etc.) but this module does none of that.  This is for the basic 
read-it-in and write-it-out -- which might just fit the bill.

This module will read an Excel (XLSX) file into a three-level arrayref.  The first
level is the worksheets, second level is the rows, and third level is the cells, such that:

	$$my_data[4][2][10] --> Worksheet 5, Row 3, Column 11 (aka as Column K)
	
Form a three-level arrayref to represent worksheets/rows/cells in this way, and you can create
a plain Excel XLSX file.  No formatting or formulas.  Ready for Tableau or just to confuse
your favorite front-line manager.

I put this together because I was offended at how difficult it is just to create an Excel
file in certain non-Perl environments, and since Excel is just a part of life for so many of us,
it really should be dead-simple.

To pursue additional Excel features, please see the excellent L<Excel::Writer::XLSX> and 
L<Spreadsheet::XLSX> modules, of which this module is just a simple abstraction.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# create the object to read/write excel files
	my $xlsx = Excel::Grinder->new('/opt/data/excel_files'); 
	# the directory can be anywhere that is writable; leave blank for /tmp/excel_grinder

	# to create a two-worksheet Excel workbook at /opt/data/excel_files/our_family.xlsx
	my $full_file_path = $xlsx->write_excel(
		'filename' => 'our_family.xlsx',
		'headings_in_data' => 1,
		'worksheet_names' => ['Dogs','People'],
		'the_data' => [
			[
				['Name','Main Trait','Age Type'],
				['Ginger','Wonderful','Old'],
				['Pepper','Loving','Passed'],
				['Polly','Fun','Young'],
				['Daisy','Crazy','Puppy']
			],
			[
				['Name','Main Trait','Age Type'],
				['Melanie','Smart','Oldish'],
				['Lorelei','Fun','Young'],
				['Eric','Fat','Old']
			]
		],
	);	
	
	# if you prebuilt had that three-level array in $our_family_data:
	$full_file_path = $xlsx->write_excel(
		'filename' => 'our_family.xlsx',
		'headings_in_data' => 1,
		'worksheet_names' => ['Dogs','People'],	
		'the_data' => $our_family_data
	);
	
	# to read that spreadsheet back into an three-level arrayref that is just like
	# what we fed in to write_excel() above:	
	my $family_data = $xlsx->read_excel('our_family.xlsx');

	# Now you can modify or add to $family_data, and overwrite our_family.xlsx 
	# or create another XLSX file.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates a new object to use this module.  Accepts a 'default directory' path for where
to save / load the Excel files:

	$xlsx = Excel::Grinder->new('/home/ginger/excel_files');
	
If you leave out that directory argument, the default is /tmp/excel_grinder .

=head2 write_excel()

Take a properly-formed three-level array and create an XLSX file.  The simplest
way to invoke.

	$full_file_path = $xlsx->write_excel(
		'filename' => 'some_filename.xlsx',
		'the_data' => $some_data
	);
	
The return value is the full location (file path) of the new file.

'Properly-formed' means the data itself is really at the third level,
while the first two just organize it into worksheets and rows:

	$websites = [
		[
			[ 'Facebook','https://www.facebook.com', ],
			[ 'LinkedIn','https://www.linkedin.com', ],
			[ 'Google','https://www.google.com', ],
		],
		[
			[ 'CPAN','https://metacpan.org/', ],
			[ 'Perl.Org','https://www.perl.org/', ]
		],
	];
	
This represents an Excel workbook with two worksheets.  The first one has three two-column rows,
and the second one has two two-column rows.  Often, a structure like this would be defined 
during a loop of some kind, or perhaps feed from the results of DBI's fetchall_arrayref().
Yes, you might just have one worksheet, but you would still prepare a three-level arrayref,
with just one element at the top.  Sorry.

The 'headings_in_data' arg tells use to make each worksheet's first row all caps to 
indicate those are the headings.  The 'worksheet_names' argument is the arrayref to 
the names to put on the nice tabs for the worksheets.  Both 'worksheet_names' and 
'headings_in_data' are optional.

=head2 read_excel()

This does the exact opposite of write_excel() in that it reads in an XLSX
file and returns the arrayref in the exact same format as what write_excel()
receives.  All it needs is the absolute filepath for an XLSX file:

	$the_data = $xlsx->read_excel('/opt/data/excel_files/DATABASE_NAME/ginger.xlsx');
	# or you can just provide the filename, so long as it is in the default
	# directory path provided in new()

@$the_data will look like the structure in the examples above.  Try it out ;)
